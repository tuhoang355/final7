        <h3>I'm <strong>{{ .Site.Params.author }}</strong>, a Senior BSA-Biology Student at the University of Texas. I am a first generation college student. After I graduate, I plan to go back to school in order to get a master and then hopefully a PhD in the sciences so I could spread the knowledges I gained throughout my educational journey to others.</h3>
        <h3>I love all things sciences, computer science, and maths.</h3>
